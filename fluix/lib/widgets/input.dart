  /// The [focusNode] is a long-lived object that's typically managed by a
  /// [StatefulWidget] parent. See [FocusNode] for more information.
  ///
  /// To give the keyboard focus to this widget, provide a [focusNode] and then
  /// use the current [FocusScope] to request the focus:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// FocusScope.of(context).requestFocus(myFocusNode);
  /// ```
  ///
  /// This happens automatically when the widget is tapped.
  ///
  /// To be notified when the widget gains or loses the focus, add a listener

  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// focusNode.addListener(() { print(myFocusNode.hasFocus); });
  /// ```
  ///
  /// If null, this widget will create its own [FocusNode].
  ///
  /// ## Keyboard
  ///
  /// Requesting the focus will typically cause the keyboard to be shown
  /// if it's not showing already.
  ///
  /// On Android, the user can hide the keyboard - without changing the focus -
  /// with the system back button. They can restore the keyboard's visibility
  /// by tapping on a text field.  The user might hide the keyboard and
  /// switch to a physical keyboard, or they might just need to get it
  /// out of the way for a moment, to expose something it's
  /// obscuring. In this case requesting the focus again will not
  /// cause the focus to change, and will not make the keyboard visible.
  ///

  /// showing when it is tapped by calling [EditableTextState.requestKeyboard()].

  /// field showing how many characters have been entered. If set to a number
  /// greater than 0, it will also display the maximum number allowed. If set
  /// to [TextField.noMaxLength] then only the current character count is displayed.
  ///
  /// After [maxLength] characters have been input, additional input
  /// is ignored, unless [maxLengthEnforced] is set to false. The text field
  /// enforces the length with a [LengthLimitingTextInputFormatter], which is
  /// evaluated after the supplied [inputFormatters], if any.
  ///
  /// This value must be either null, [TextField.noMaxLength], or greater than 0.
  /// If null (the default) then there is no limit to the number of characters
  /// that can be entered. If set to [TextField.noMaxLength], then no limit will
  /// be enforced, but the number of characters entered will still be displayed.
  ///
  /// Whitespace characters (e.g. newline, space, tab) are included in the
  /// character count.
  ///
  /// If [maxLengthEnforced] is set to false, then more than [maxLength]
  /// characters may be entered, but the error counter and divider will
  /// switch to the [decoration.errorStyle] when the limit is exceeded.
  ///
  /// ## Limitations
  ///
  /// The text field does not currently count Unicode grapheme clusters (i.e.
  /// characters visible to the user), it counts Unicode scalar values, which
  /// leaves out a number of useful possible characters (like many emoji and
  /// composed characters), so this will be inaccurate in the presence of those
  /// characters. If you expect to encounter these kinds of characters, be
  /// generous in the maxLength used.
  ///
  /// For instance, the character "√∂" can be represented as '\u{006F}\u{0308}',
  /// which is the letter "o" followed by a composed diaeresis "¬®", or it can
  /// be represented as '\u{00F6}', which is the Unicode scalar value "LATIN
  /// SMALL LETTER O WITH DIAERESIS". In the first case, the text field will
  /// count two characters, and the second case will be counted as one
  /// character, even though the user can see no difference in the input.
  ///
  /// Similarly, some emoji are represented by multiple scalar values. The
  /// Unicode "THUMBS UP SIGN + MEDIUM SKIN TONE MODIFIER", "üëçüèΩ", should be
  /// counted as a single character, but because it is a combination of two
  /// Unicode scalar values, '\u{1F44D}\u{1F3FD}', it is counted as two
  /// characters.
  ///
  /// See also:
  ///

  ///    counts characters, and how it may differ from the intuitive meaning.

  /// [maxLength] is exceeded.
